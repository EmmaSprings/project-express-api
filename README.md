# Project Express API


## The problem

This weeks projects was about backend and get an understanding by adding endpoints and and routes. I also chose to build my own API file - print-collection.json to better understand what is added and how. It is not big but I also chose to create a very simple single page front end application to see that it worked. This can be seen here https://ephemeral-sherbet-9ff17e.netlify.app/

I still need to read up more on this with backend, express and API, but am happy that I got things to work and will take it from there, as backend is not my favourite. I like the visual part that comes with front end. However I like to understand and be able to build a simple foundation that this API is.
